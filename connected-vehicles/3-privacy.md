# Infotainment Settings

Within the vehicle infotainment system, the user can select between **3 privacy settings**:
- <strong>Data & Location:</strong> geolocation & subscribed services relevant data are refreshed.
- <strong>Data:</strong> subscribed services relevant data's is refreshed, but geolocation is not.

### Effect on WebPortal

As an embedded application developer (**Webportal v1 & v2**), only API that match the current privacy are available. That's why your application needs to handle the privacy settings selected by the user. See [privacy webportal v1]({{site.baseurl}}/webportal/v1/quickstart/#privacy-mode) or [privacy Webportal v2]({{site.baseurl}}/webportal/v2/overview/privacy/#article) for more info.

You can retrieve required level of privacy of each API in the references: [Webportal v1]({{site.baseurl}}/webportal/v1/api-reference/list/#article) or [Webportal v2]({{site.baseurl}}/webportal/v2/api-reference/list/#article).

### Effect on Web API


If you are a fleet owner (**WEB API B2B v2 & v3**) you can access your vehicle data. However, in order to be compliant with GDPR, you should use the query parameter `profile` as described [here]({{site.baseurl}}/webapi/b2b/api-reference-v2/specification/#section/API-output:/Data-profile).

If you are developing end-user applications (**Web API B2C v4**), you can only access data that match the current privacy mode of the vehicle.

> **Reminder:** Whatever the privacy selected in the vehicle, you can only access the data allowed in the data scope of the *[Connected Vehicle Services]({{site.baseurl}}/connected-vehicles/access-requirements/#vehicle-connected-services)* your vehicle subscribed.
