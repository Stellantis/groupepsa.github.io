## How does it works?

Vehicles are using various **sensors** which aim to improve security and driving experience in the vehicle, these data are available for the development of [in-vehicle applications]({{ site.baseurl }}/webportal/) but this Web API provide vehicle data from **outside of the vehicle**.

If an application require info about a vehicle, appropriate data are **collected & sent** to Stellantis servers via cellular network. This make sure that the data are available whether the vehicle is online or not.


Data are then **unified & processed**, these steps ensure that thedata provided within this API share the same format in spite of the different types of vehicles and generation,

> **Data Scope:** Only required data are available within this API, check out [data scope]({{site.baseurl}}/webapi/b2c/overview/data-scope/#article).

> **Data Refreshment:** data are refreshed from the vehicle to Stellantis on a **regular basis** (every 1 min before 2019, more frequently after) and also on **vehicle events** *(ex: turning on the vehicle)*.
