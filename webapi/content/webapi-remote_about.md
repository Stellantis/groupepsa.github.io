# How does it works?

**Step1: create a callback**

First, you will have to set up a remote callback.
If you are already working with monitors, it is almost the same as posting a {% if page.subsection == 'b2b' %}[monitor]({{site.baseurl}}/webapi/b2b/monitor/set-up/#post-monitor-request){% elsif page.subsection == 'b2c' %}[monitor]({{site.baseurl}}/webapi/b2c/monitor/about/set-up/#post-monitor-request){% endif %}. 

Callback is where you define the parameters of your **webhook** (URL, authentication) and the structure of the **HTTP request** you will receive as a notification.

Callbacks are **specific** to certain remotes, as you can subscribe them to one or more actions & they are **reusable** as you can use the same callback every time you need to execute a similar command.

It is possible to set a retry policy with a specific number and frequency, itâ€™s useful in case of your webhook is temporary unavailable. You can also set a batch notify policy.

>**Note:** At least one callback is required to post a remote action. But you can use **only one callback** for all your remote actions if you need only one webhook configuration. Indeed, if you need to have different webhook or notification policies, you can set several callbacks.

**Step2: send a remote action**

Once your callback is created, you will be able to **send remote** request to your vehicle (through Stellantis's network).
While the command is being processed by the vehicle, you will receive callback reports in your webhook.

When you send a remote action to a vehicle, you will receive **several notifications** as the action is processing: 
- Pending: The remote action is in process (*Accepted*, *Waking-Up*, *Send* etc). You can receive several pending events.
- Done: The remote action is complete (*Success*, *Failure* etc).
