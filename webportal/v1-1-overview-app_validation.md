# APP VALIDATION

## DEVELOPMENT

To start developing your Application, you just need some web development skills, and a computer. As embedded apps in Webportal are only HTML CSS an JavaScript, it's very easy to start development and testing on a personal computer.

## VALIDATION 

As Stellantis needs to control its [infotainment system]({{site.baseurl}}/webportal/v1/overview/infotainment-system/#article) not evry APPs are allowed on the plateform. 

Embedded webportal is not an open plateform as application for smartphone, if you want to start the process of development for Webportal, please contact us to set-up together your project.

>Some functionalities are restricted and so may require special permission from Stellantis in order to be used in your application.

After your development process Stellatis webportal team will review your App and proceed to deployment in vehicles.
