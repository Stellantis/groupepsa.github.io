# HOW TO GET WEBPORTAL RESPONSE

## ONMESSAGE

[Onmessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowEventHandlers/onmessage) is a browser API that you need to work with using Stellantis Embedded Webportal for ex Groupe PSA brands (CitroÃ«n, DS, Peugeot, Opel and Vauxhall).

As your App is a dedicated [Window object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window), postMessage is a way to receive message from Webportal. Doing so, you're app is able to receive info that you request with [postMessage]({{site.baseurl}}/webportal/v2/quickstart/request/#article)

Here is a typical  that you need to send to webportal in order to communicate with the vehicle:

```js
// Response
this.onmessage(function(e) {
	var idpResponse = e.data;
	console.log(idpResponse);
})
```
